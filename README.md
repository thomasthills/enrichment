# Online code for Hills, T. T. **Learning, clutter, and age-related cognitive decline: An enrichment-based account of the interdependence between fluid and crystallized intelligence**"

The code for the figures and simulations in the manuscript are in EnrichmentCode.Rmd.

The simulations are set to run for 100 iterations, instead of 1000 in the manuscript, as this takes less time to run.  In fact, 10 is sufficient to see the trends. 

The supplementary materials code is coming soon.
