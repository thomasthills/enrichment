  AUTHOR = {Gonzalez, Cleotilde and Dutt, Varun},
  ANNOTATION = {Decisions-based on experience have been subdivided into two common forms: sampling and repeated-choice. These two paradigms have been studied independently, and different cognitive processes are often assumed to take place for each. Using instance-based learning theory (Gonzalez {\&}amp; Dutt, 2011) attempted to demonstrate that they potentially share common underlying cognitive processes, which drive both the inconsequential and consequential search and decision processes underlying these two paradigms. very different models won the competition in the TPT (Erev, Ert, Roth, et al., 2010)--this implies differnent cognitive processes. The explanation for the DE gap are different for sampling and RC -- for sampling, "reliance on small samples", "reliance on recent experience", and round wise comparison. G {\&}amp; D note that "many researchers assume that the exploration-explitation tradeoff does not exist in the sampling paradigm because these two stages occur separately: Exploration occurs during sampling, whereas exploitation occurs when the choice is made for real (Camilleri {\&}amp; Newell, 2011; Rakow {\&}amp; Newell, 2010)." G{\&}amp;D argue that both RC and sampling have similar levels of risky choices (for the final decision?), but have different amounts of A-rate, with more A-rate for the sampling paradigm. They argue this may be driven by a similar mechanism because A-rate is correlated between RC and sampling paradigms. Though G{\&}amp;D do not say whether the correlations are done by problem or by participant, the implication is that in either case the processes may be simlar. how is IBLT made sensitive to the costs of search or the size of payoffs? blending is similar to other DFE models in terms of how they determine the value of a particular option--however, as sampling is not-consequential in the sampling paradigm, there is no need to try and maximize payoffs during exploration. you should be able to predict the final decision based on the dominant option during sampling. the decay in A-rate is due to subjects falling out of the data. the instance-based learning model does not capture the relationship between A-rate and total sample size. top of p17{\ldots}the reduction in A-rate over time for both paradigms?!},
